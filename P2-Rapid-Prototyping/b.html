        <p>With the intention of counteracting the "star" cult faction that had begun to form around him, Clapton assembled a new band composed of Delaney and Bonnie's former <a href="/wiki/Rhythm_section" title="Rhythm section">rhythm section</a>, <a href="/wiki/Bobby_Whitlock" title="Bobby Whitlock">Bobby Whitlock</a> as keyboardist and vocalist, <a href="/wiki/Carl_Radle" title="Carl Radle">Carl Radle</a> as the bassist, and drummer <a href="/wiki/Jim_Gordon_(musician)" title="Jim Gordon (musician)">Jim Gordon</a>, with Clapton playing guitar. It was his intention to show that he need not fill a starring role, and functioned well as a member of an ensemble.<sup id="cite_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-33"><span>[</span>33<span>]</span></a></sup> During this period, Clapton was increasingly influenced by <a href="/wiki/The_Band" title="The Band">The Band</a> and their album <i><a href="/wiki/Music_from_Big_Pink" title="Music from Big Pink">Music from Big Pink</a></i>, saying, "What I appreciated about The Band was that they were more concerned with songs and singing. They would have three- and four-part harmonies, and the guitar was put back into perspective as being accompaniment. That suited me well, because I had gotten so tired of the virtuosity—or <i>pseudo</i>-virtuosity—thing of long, boring guitar solos just because they were expected. The Band brought things back into perspective. The priority was the song."<sup id="cite_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-34"><span>[</span>34<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
        
        <p>The band was originally called "Eric Clapton and Friends". The name "Derek and the Dominos" was a fluke that occurred when the band's provisional name of "Del and the Dynamos" was misread as Derek and the Dominos.<sup id="cite_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-35"><span>[</span>35<span>]</span></a></sup> Clapton's biography states that Tony Ashton of <a href="/wiki/Ashton,_Gardner_and_Dyke" title="Ashton, Gardner and Dyke">Ashton, Gardner and Dyke</a> told Clapton to call the band "Del and the Dominos", since "Del" was his nickname for Eric Clapton. Del and Eric were combined and the final name became "Derek and the Dominos".<sup id="cite_ref-nxfddy_36-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-nxfddy-36"><span>[</span>36<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
        
        <p>Clapton's close friendship with George Harrison brought him into contact with Harrison's wife, <a href="/wiki/Pattie_Boyd" title="Pattie Boyd">Pattie Boyd</a>, with whom he became deeply infatuated. When she spurned his advances, Clapton's unrequited affections prompted most of the material for the Dominos' album, <i><a href="/wiki/Layla_and_Other_Assorted_Love_Songs" title="Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs">Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs</a></i> (1970). Heavily blues-influenced, the album features the twin lead guitars of Duane Allman and Clapton, with Allman's <a href="/wiki/Slide_guitar" title="Slide guitar">slide guitar</a> as a key ingredient of the sound. Working at <a href="/wiki/Criteria_Studios" title="Criteria Studios">Criteria Studios</a> in Miami with <a href="/wiki/Atlantic_Records" title="Atlantic Records">Atlantic Records</a> producer <a href="/wiki/Tom_Dowd" title="Tom Dowd">Tom Dowd</a>, who had worked with Clapton on Cream's <i>Disraeli Gears</i>, the band recorded a double album.</p>
        
        <p>The album features the hit love song "<a href="/wiki/Layla" title="Layla">Layla</a>", inspired by the classical poet of <a href="/wiki/Persian_literature" title="Persian literature">Persian literature</a>, <a href="/wiki/Nizami_Ganjavi" title="Nizami Ganjavi">Nizami Ganjavi</a>'s <i><a href="/wiki/Layla_and_Majnun" title="Layla and Majnun">The Story of Layla and Majnun</a></i>, a copy of which <a href="/wiki/Ian_Dallas" title="Ian Dallas" class="mw-redirect">Ian Dallas</a> had given to Clapton. The book moved Clapton profoundly, as it was the tale of a young man who fell hopelessly in love with a beautiful, unavailable woman and who went crazy because he could not marry her.<sup id="cite_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-37"><span>[</span>37<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-38"><span>[</span>38<span>]</span></a></sup> The two parts of "Layla" were recorded in separate sessions: the opening guitar section was recorded first, and for the second section, laid down several months later, drummer Jim Gordon composed and played the piano part.<sup id="cite_ref-nxfddy_36-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-nxfddy-36"><span>[</span>36<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
        
        <p>The <i>Layla</i> LP was actually recorded by a five-piece version of the group, thanks to the unforeseen inclusion of guitarist <a href="/wiki/Duane_Allman" title="Duane Allman">Duane Allman</a> of <a href="/wiki/The_Allman_Brothers_Band" title="The Allman Brothers Band">The Allman Brothers Band</a>. A few days into the Layla sessions, Dowd—who was also producing the Allmans—invited Clapton to an Allman Brothers outdoor concert in Miami. The two guitarists met first on stage, then played all night in the studio, and became friends. Duane first added his <a href="/wiki/Slide_guitar" title="Slide guitar">slide guitar</a> to "<a href="/wiki/Tell_the_Truth_(song)" title="Tell the Truth (song)">Tell the Truth</a>" and "<a href="/wiki/Nobody_Knows_You_When_You%27re_Down_and_Out" title="Nobody Knows You When You're Down and Out">Nobody Knows You When You're Down and Out</a>". In four days, the five-piece Dominos recorded "<a href="/wiki/Key_to_the_Highway" title="Key to the Highway">Key to the Highway</a>", "<a href="/wiki/Have_You_Ever_Loved_a_Woman" title="Have You Ever Loved a Woman">Have You Ever Loved a Woman</a>" (a <a href="/wiki/Blues_standard" title="Blues standard" class="mw-redirect">blues standard</a> popularised by <a href="/wiki/Freddie_King" title="Freddie King">Freddie King</a> and others), and "Why Does Love Got to be So Sad". In September, Duane briefly left the sessions for gigs with his own band, and the four-piece Dominos recorded "I Looked Away", "<a href="/wiki/Bell_Bottom_Blues_(Derek_and_the_Dominos_song)" title="Bell Bottom Blues (Derek and the Dominos song)">Bell Bottom Blues</a>", and "Keep on Growing". Duane returned to record "I am Yours", "Anyday", and "It's Too Late". On 9 September, they recorded Hendrix's "<a href="/wiki/Little_Wing" title="Little Wing">Little Wing</a>" and the title track. The following day, the final track, "It's Too Late", was recorded.<sup id="cite_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-39"><span>[</span>39<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

        <p>Tragedy dogged the group throughout its brief career. During the sessions, Clapton was devastated by news of the death of Jimi Hendrix; eight days previously the band had cut a cover of "Little Wing" as a tribute to Hendrix. On <span class="nowrap">17 September</span> 1970, one day before Hendrix's death, Clapton had purchased a <a href="/wiki/Left-handedness" title="Left-handedness" class="mw-redirect">left-handed</a> <a href="/wiki/Fender_Stratocaster" title="Fender Stratocaster">Fender Stratocaster</a> that he had planned to give to Hendrix as a birthday gift. Adding to Clapton's woes, the <i>Layla</i> album received only lukewarm reviews upon release. The shaken group undertook a U.S. tour without Allman, who had returned to the Allman Brothers Band. Despite Clapton's later admission that the tour took place amidst a veritable blizzard of drugs and alcohol, it resulted in the live double album <i><a href="/wiki/In_Concert_(Derek_and_the_Dominos_album)" title="In Concert (Derek and the Dominos album)">In Concert</a></i>.<sup id="cite_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-40"><span>[</span>40<span>]</span></a></sup> The band had recorded several tracks for a second album in London during the spring of 1971 (five of which were released on the Eric Clapton box-set <i>Crossroads</i>), but the results were mediocre.</p>
        
        <p>A second record was in the works when a clashing of egos took place and Clapton walked, thus disbanding the group. Allman was killed in a motorcycle accident on <span class="nowrap">29 October</span> 1971. Clapton wrote later in his autobiography that he and Allman were inseparable during the sessions in Florida; he talked about Allman as the "musical brother I'd never had but wished I did."<sup id="cite_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-41"><span>[</span>41<span>]</span></a></sup> Although Radle would remain Clapton's bass player until the summer of 1979 (Radle died in May 1980 from the effects of alcohol and narcotics), it would be 2003 before Clapton and Whitlock appeared together again (Clapton guested on Whitlock's appearance on the <i><a href="/wiki/Later_with_Jools_Holland" title="Later with Jools Holland" class="mw-redirect">Later with Jools Holland</a></i> show). Another tragic footnote to the Dominos story was the fate of drummer <a href="/wiki/Jim_Gordon_(musician)" title="Jim Gordon (musician)">Jim Gordon</a>, who was an undiagnosed <a href="/wiki/Schizophrenia" title="Schizophrenia">schizophrenic</a> and years later murdered his mother during a <a href="/wiki/Psychosis" title="Psychosis">psychotic episode</a>. Gordon was confined to 16-years-to-life imprisonment, later being moved to a mental institution, where he remains today.<sup id="cite_ref-unuhsh_18-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-unuhsh-18"><span>[</span>18<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
